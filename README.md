# Coding: Please attempt to finish the test within 20 minutes.
To test your software development skills in the real-world, you may use your own development environment (IDE) to create and test your code for this question. Once you are satisfied with your code, copy and paste it into the designated text box of the assessment.

# Scenario:
You are working on a food delivery service website, where customers can place orders for food items from different restaurants. The website must be highly responsive, accessible, and secure, and it should provide a great user experience for customers.

# Task:
Using a single file in any front end programming language, implement a feature that allows customers to search for restaurants by name or cuisine type. The feature should provide real-time search results and allow customers to filter results by various attributes, such as rating, distance, and price range.

# Requirements:

- The feature must be highly responsive and provide real-time search results.
- The feature must be accessible, allowing customers to use keyboard navigation and providing proper labeling and aria attributes.
- The feature must be secure, protecting user data and preventing attacks.
- The code should be written using best practices, including proper naming conventions, commenting, and separation of concerns.

# Non-functional requirement:
The code should be optimized for performance, minimizing the amount of data transferred and reducing the number of requests made to the server.

# Instructions:
Use any front end programming language of your choice.
You have 20 minutes to complete this task.

# Hints:
You may use a sample data set of restaurants to test the feature.
You may use any open source libraries or frameworks to implement the feature.
